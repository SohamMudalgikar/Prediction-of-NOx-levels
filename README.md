## Prediction-of-NOx-levels
In this project, the primary objective is to develop a statistical model for predicting flue gas emissions, namely Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), based on data collected in a power plant located in Turkey's Northwestern region through sensors aggregated over an hour and understand the impact on NOx levels due to the remaining nine variables.
Correlation plot inference states strong collinearity between predicting variables as well as with response variable. After fitting the linear model, it is found that only AT, AP, CDP, and TEY are significant parameters but showed a high variation inflation factor (heteroscedasticity). A complete second-order model is developed consisting of 55 variables reduced to 21 variable models by grouping highly correlated variables in a group and using one variable from each group as a prediction variable. A second-order multiple variable regression model is fitted using 11 predictors which had the least MSE of 8.22.
Subsequently, variable selection models are used for the Selection of variables out of 21 variable models. The main criteria for model selection were AIC, BIC, Adjusted R2, and MSE, with 10-fold cross-validation performed. Regularization techniques are applied to the second-order Model. PCR model with 20 variables yields an MSE of 9.66. Decision tree methods were also used with the expectation of increased accuracy on the cost of reduced interpretability. However, the results obtained are different; MSE for bagging and the random forest is significantly high compared to Gradient boosting MSE of 9.66.
After further analysis, it is found that the Multiple Variable regression model is the best in terms of accuracy, followed by Model develop on forward Selection, PCR and Gradient boosting. However, if interpretability is preferred over accuracy, the backward selection model is the best as it uses the lowest predictors (9).
